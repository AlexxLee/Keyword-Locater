# Keyword-Locater
Locate a keyword within a directory. Hope it can help on my final exams.

## What has been done (roughly) so far
* Output the pptx file name and the page numbers for each pptx file
* Locate a keyword in a nested directory  

## TODO
* Resulting panels show a link to open the file
* More error-handlings
